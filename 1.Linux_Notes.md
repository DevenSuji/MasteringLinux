### <b><ins>KDUMP</ins></b> 
Allows you to use a KDUMP kernel. This is a kernel that creates a core dump if anything goes wrong.  
  
### <b><ins>Deafult File System In RHEL 8</ins></b>
RHEL 8 by default uses the XFS file system. This file system cannot be shrunk; it can only be expanded. Therefore, it is sometimes a better choice to use Ext4.  
  
### <b><ins>Benefits of RHEL 8</ins></b>
The most important things that you get in the official RHEL 8 Server release is access to the Red Hat Customer Portal. Through this portal, you have access to a wide variety of information regarding RHEL, in addition to updates provided through Red Hat Network (RHN). In particular, the Red Hat knowledge base is invaluable; you can use it to find answers to many common problems that have been posted there by Red Hat consultants.

### <b><ins>Alias</ins></b>
An alias is a command that a user can define as needed. Some aliases are provided by default; type alias on the command line to get an overview. To define an alias, use alias newcommand='oldcommand', as in the default alias ll='ls -l --color=auto' that has already been created on your system. Aliases are executed before anything else. So, if you have an alias with the name ll but also a command with the name ll, the alias will always take precedence, unless a complete pathname is used.  
  
Steps to create an alias:  
* Ensure that you are in your home directory.
* Run vi .bashrc.
* At the end of this file add alias cls='clear'.
* Save and Close.
* Log off and login.
* The command cls should clear your terminal window now.

```bash
cls='clear --color=auto'
```

### <b><ins>VIM Commands</ins></b>

| Esc | Switches from input mode to command mode. Press this key before typing any command. |
| i, a | Switches from command mode to input mode at (i) or after (a) the current cursor position. |
| o | Opens a new line beloew the current cursor position and goes to input mode. | 
| :wq | Writes the current file and quits. |
| :q! | Quits the file without applying any changes. The ! forces the command to do its work. Only add the ! if you really know what you are doing. |
| :w | filename Writes the current file with a new filename. |
| dd | Deletes the current line. |
| yy | Copies the current line. |
| p | Pastes the current selection. |
| v | Enters visual mode, which allows you to select a block of text using the arrow keys. Use d to cut the selection or y to copy it. |
| u | Undoes the last command. Repeat as often as necessary. |
| Ctrl-r | Redoes the last undo. |

### <b><ins>MAN Pages</ins></b>

Man pages are categorized in different sections. The most relevant sections for
system administrators are as follows:  
■ 1: Executable programs or shell commands  
■ 5: File formats and conventions  
■ 8: System administration commands  
  
There are also sections that provide in-depth details about your Linux system, such as the sections about system calls and library calls. When using man -k, you’ll get results from all of these sections. To limit the results that display, it makes sense to
use grep to show only those sections that are relevant for what you need. So, if you are looking for the configuration file that has something to do with passwords, use
```bash
man -k password | grep 5
```   
Or if you are looking for the command that an administrator would use to create partitions, use 
```bash
man -k partition | grep 8
```
Another useful man option is -f. The command man -f <somecommand> displays a short description of the item as found in the mandb database. This may help you when deciding whether this man page contains the information you are looking for.
