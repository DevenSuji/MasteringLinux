What is ACL?  
  
ACL provides an additional, more flexible permission mechanism for file system. It is designed to assist with UNIX file permissions. ACL allows you to give permissions for any user or group to any disk resource.  
  
  
Use of ACL:
* Think of a scenario in which a particular user is not a member of a group created by you but still you want to give some read or write access, how can you do it without making user a member of a group, here come in picture ACL and it helps us to do the same.  
* ACLs are used to make flexible permission mechanism in Kinux.
* From Linux man pages, ACLs are used to define more fine-grained discretionary access rights for files and directories.
* The command to assign and remove ACL permissions are <b><ins><i>setfacl</i></ins></b> and  <b><ins><i>getfacl</i></ins></b>.
