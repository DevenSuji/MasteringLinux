### <b><ins><i>Modifying Permissions Using UGO</i></ins></b>
In Linux, file permissions are applied to 3 types of users viz User, Group and Others.
The CHMOD command works on a file, directory and links.
```bash
-rwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 0 Jul 22 12:42 jerry
```
In the above example in the first you see a hypen (-). This indicates we are looking at the file.
The first occurance of rwx is the permission set for the user.
The second occurance of rwx is the permission set for group.
The third occurance of rwx is the permission set for others.
1 is the counter.
The first occurance of root is the user.
The first occurance of root is the group.
0 is the others.
July 22 is the date.
12:42 is the time.
jerry is the name of the file. 

```bash
chmod a-r jerry # This will remove read permission for all the users from the file jerry. Note a here stand for all.
chmod o+r jerry # This will add read permission for others on the file jerry. Note o here stand for others.
chmod ug+r jerry # This will add read permission for user and group on the file jerry. Note u and g here stand for user and group. 
```
