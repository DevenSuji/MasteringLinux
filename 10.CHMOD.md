# <b><ins><i>Modifying Permissions Using CHMOD</i></ins></b>

In Linux, file permissions are applied to 3 types of users viz User, Group and Others.
```bash
-rwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 0 Jul 22 12:42 jerry
```
In the above example in the first you see a hypen (-). This indicates we are looking at the file.
The first occurance of rwx is the permission set for the user.
The second occurance of rwx is the permission set for group.
The third occurance of rwx is the permission set for others.
1 is the counter.
The first occurance of root is the user.
The first occurance of root is the group.
0 is the others.
July 22 is the date.
12:42 is the time.
jerry is the name of the file.
