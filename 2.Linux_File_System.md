# <b><ins><i>Linux File System</i></ins></b>  
  
OS store data on a disk drives using a structure called a filesystem, consisting of files, directories and the information needed to access and locate them.  
  
There are many different types of filesystems. In general, improvements have been made to the filesystems with the new releases of OS, and each new file system has been given a different name. E.g. ext3, ext4, XFS, NTFS, FAT etc.  
  
Linux filesystem store information in the hierarchy of directories and files. 
  
### <b><ins>Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)</ins></b>

The layout of the Linux file system is defined in the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), and this file system hierarchy is described in man 7 hier.  

| Directory | Use |   
|:-------|:----------|
| / | The root directory. This is where the file system tree starts. |
| /boot | Contains all files and directories that are needed to boot the Linux kernel. In other words it contains files that are used by the boot loader (grub.cfg) |
| /root | The home directory of the root user. It is not the same as / (root of the file system) |
| /dev | Contains device files that are used for accessing physical devices. This directory is essential during boot. E.g. disk, cdrom, speakers, flashdrive, keyboard etc. |
| /etc | Contains configuration files that are used by programs and services on your server. This directory is essential during boot. |
| /bin => /usr/bin | Everyday user commands |
| /sbin => /usr/sbin | System/filesystem commands |
| /opt | Used for optional packages that may be installed on your server. |
| /proc | Used by the proc file system. This is a file system structure that gives access to kernel information. |
| /lib => user/lib | C programming library files needed by the comands and apps |
| /tmp | Contains temporary files that may be deleted without any warning during boot. |
| /home  | Used for local user home directories. |
| /var | Contains files that may change in size dynamically, such as log files, mail boxes, and spool files. |
| /run | Contains process and user-specific information that has been created since the last boot. |
| /mnt | External filsystem mounts are seen here |
| /media | For CDROM mounts |
| /srv | May be used for data by services like NFS, FTP, and HTTP. |
| /sys | Used as an interface to different hardware devices that is managed by the Linux kernel and associated processes. |
| /usr | Contains subdirectories with program files, libraries for these program files, and documentation about them. |

### <b><ins>Directory Listing Attributes</ins></b>  
  
| Type | Number of Links | Owner | Group | Size | Month | Day | Time | Name |   
|:-------|:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|    
| drwxr-xr-x | 21 | root | root | 4096 | Feb | 27 | 13:33 | var |  
| lrwxrwxrwx | 1 | root | root | 7 | Feb | 27 | 13:36 | bin |  
| -rw-r-r-- | 1 | root | root | 0 | Mar | 2 | 11:15 | testfile |    
  
Note: Under type, d stands for directory, l stands for link and - stands for a normal file.

### <b><ins>Commands</ins></b>
* mount : The mount command gives an overview of all mounted devices. To get this information, the /proc/mounts file is read, where the kernel keeps information about all current mounts. It shows kernel interfaces also, which may lead to a long list of mounted devices being displayed.
```bash
mount
```
  
* df -Th : The df -Th command was designed to show available disk space on mounted devices; it includes most of the system mounts. Because it will look on all mounted file systems, it is a convenient command to get an overview of current system mounts. The -h option summarizes the output of the command in a human-readable way, and the -T option shows which file system type is used on the different mounts.
```bash
df -Th
```
* findmnt: The findmnt command shows mounts and the relationship that exists between the different mounts. Because the output of the mount command is a bit overwhelming, you may like the output of findmnt.
```bash
findmnt
```
