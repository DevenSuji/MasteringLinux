# <b><ins><i>Linux File System</i></ins></b>  
  
OS store data on a disk drives using a structure called a filesystem, consisting of files, directories and the information needed to access and locate them.  
  
There are many different types of filesystems. In general, improvements have been made to the filesystems with the new releases of OS, and each new file system has been given a different name. E.g. ext3, ext4, XFS, NTFS, FAT etc.  
  
Linux filesystem store information in the hierarchy of directories and files. 
  
### <b><ins>Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)</ins></b>

The layout of the Linux file system is defined in the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), and this file system hierarchy is described in man 7 hier.  

| Directory | Use |   
|:-------|:----------|
| / | The root directory. This is where the file system tree starts. |
| /boot | Contains all files and directories that are needed to boot the Linux kernel. |
| /dev | Contains device files that are used for accessing physical devices. This directory is essential during boot. |
| /etc | Contains configuration files that are used by programs and services on your server. This directory is essential during boot. |
| /home  | Used for local user home directories. |
| /media, /mnt | Contain directories that are used for mounting devices in the file system tree. |
| /opt | Used for optional packages that may be installed on your server. |
| /proc | Used by the proc file system. This is a file system structure that gives access to kernel information. |
| /root | The home directory of the root user. |
| /run | Contains process and user-specific information that has been created since the last boot. |
| /srv | May be used for data by services like NFS, FTP, and HTTP. |
| /sys | Used as an interface to different hardware devices that is managed by the Linux kernel and associated processes. |
| /tmp | Contains temporary files that may be deleted without any warning during boot. |
| /usr | Contains subdirectories with program files, libraries for these program files, and documentation about them. |
| /var | Contains files that may change in size dynamically, such as log files, mail boxes, and spool files. |

### <b><ins>Commands</ins></b>
* mount : The mount command gives an overview of all mounted devices. To get this information, the /proc/mounts file is read, where the kernel keeps information about all current mounts. It shows kernel interfaces also, which may lead to a long list of mounted devices being displayed.
```bash
mount
```
  
* df -Th : The df -Th command was designed to show available disk space on mounted devices; it includes most of the system mounts. Because it will look on all mounted file systems, it is a convenient command to get an overview of current system mounts. The -h option summarizes the output of the command in a human-readable way, and the -T option shows which file system type is used on the different mounts.
```bash
df -Th
```
* findmnt: The findmnt command shows mounts and the relationship that exists between the different mounts. Because the output of the mount command is a bit overwhelming, you may like the output of findmnt.
```bash
findmnt
```
