# <b><ins><i>Managing Files</i></ins></b>

As an administrator, you need to be able to perform common file management tasks. These tasks include the following:  
* Working with wildcards.
* Managing and working with directories.
* Working with absolute and relative pathnames.
* Listing files and directories.
* Copying files and directories.
* Moving files and directories.
* Deleting files and directories.

## <b><ins><i>Working with Wildcards</i></ins></b>

When working with files, using wildcards can make your work a lot easier. A wildcard is a shell feature that helps you refer to multiple files in an easy way.
| Wildcard | Use |   
|:-------|:----------|
| * | Refers to an unlimited number of any characters. ls *, for instance, shows all files in the current directory (except those that have a name starting with a dot). |
| ? | Used to refer to one specific character that can be any character. ls c?t would match cat as well as cut. |
| [auo] | Refers to one character that may be selected from the range that is specified between square brackets. ls c[auo]t would match cat, cut, and cot. |

## <b><ins><i>Commands</i></ins></b>

| Wildcard | Use |   
|:-------|:----------|
| cd | Brings one back to his/her home directory |
| cd .. | Goes one step back in the folder hierarchy. |
| cd / | Brings us to the root directory |
| cd /home | Takes us to /home directory |
| touch file1 | Creates and empty file by the name file1. |
| mkdir folder1 | Creates a directory by the name folder1 |
| rmdir folder1 | Deletes the folder by the name folder1 |

## <b><ins><i>Absolute and Relative Pathnames</i></ins></b>

* Absolute filename/pathname: An absolute filename, or absolute pathname, is a complete path reference to the file or
directory you want to work with. This pathname starts with the root directory, followed by all subdirectories up to the actual filename. No matter what your current directory is, absolute filenames will always work. An example of an absolute filename is /home/lisa/file1.
  
* Relative filename/pathname: A relative filename is relative to the current directory as shown with the pwd command. It contains only the elements that are required to get from the current directory up to the item you need. Suppose that your current directory is /home
(as shown by the pwd command). When you refer to the relative filename lisa/file1, you are referring to the absolute filename /home/lisa/file1.


## <b><ins><i>Listing Files and Directories</i></ins></b>

| Command | Use |   
|:-------|:----------|
| ls -l | Shows a long listing, which includes information about file properties, such as creation date and permissions. |
| ls -a | Shows all files, including hidden files. |
| ls -lrt | This is a very useful command. It shows commands sorted on modification date. You’ll see the most recently modified files last in the list. |
| ls -d | Shows the names of directories, not the contents of all directories that match the wildcards that have been used with the ls command. |
| ls -R | Shows the contents of the current directory, in addition to all of its subdirectories; that is, it Recursively descends all subdirectories. |

## <b><ins><i>Copying Files</i></ins></b>  
  
If you copy a file to a directory, but the target directory does not exist, a file will be created with the name of the alleged target directory. In many cases, that’s not the best solution and it would be better to just get an error message instead. You can
accomplish this by placing a / after the directory name, so use cp /etc/hosts /tmp/ and not cp /etc/hosts /tmp.  
  
| Command | Use |   
|:-------|:----------|
| cp /etc/hosts /tmp/file1 | Contents of the file hosts is copied over to the file by the name file1 |
| cp -R /tmp /tmp/sound/ | Recursive copy |
| cp -a ~ /tmp. | -a option keeps the permissions intact when copying |  
  
A special case when working with cp is hidden files. By default, hidden files are not copied over. There are three solutions to copy hidden files as well:  
```bash
cp /somedir/.* /tmp
``` 
This copies all files that have a name starting with a dot (the hidden files, that is) to /tmp. It gives an error message for directories whose name starts with a dot in /somedir, because the -R option was not used.  
  
```bash
cp -a /somedir/
```
This copies the entire directory /somedir, including its contents, to the current directory. So, as a result, a subdirectory somedir will
be created in the current directory.  
  
```bash
cp -a /somedir/. .
```
This copies all files, regular and hidden, to the current directory (notice the space between the two dots at the end of this command).  
  
# <b><ins><i>Creating and Removing Multiple Files</i></ins></b>  
  
```bash
touch file{1..9} # Creates 9 files with the names file1, file2, file3, file4 ....
rm file* # Deletes all the files that has a filename starting with file.
ls -l file* # Lists all the files that has a file name starting with file.
rm *.txt # Removes all the files that ends with .txt
ls -l ?ile* # Gives all the file that has any letter in the first position, but from the send position it should have ile and after that it can have anything.


## <b><ins><i>Moving  Files</i></ins></b> 
To move files, you use the mv command. This command removes the file from its current location and puts it in the new location. You can also use it to rename a file (which, in fact, is nothing else than copying and deleting the original file anyway).  
Let’s take a look at some examples:  
* mv myfile /tmp: Moves the file myfile from the current directory to /tmp.  
* mkdir somefiles; mv somefiles /tmp: First creates a directory with the name somefiles and then moves this directory to /tmp. Notice that this also works if the directory contains files.  
* mv myfile mynewfile: Renames the file myfile to a new file with the name mynewfile.  
  
## <b><ins><i>Deleting Files</i></ins></b>
```bash
rm filename # Deletes the file by the name filename
rm -r /tmp/ # Deletes the files recursively.
```

## <b><ins><i>Links</i></ins></b>
Links on Linux are like aliases that are assigned to a file. There are symbolic links, and there are hard links. To understand a link, you need to know a bit about how the Linux file system uses inodes for file system administration.

### <b><ins><i>inode</i></ins></b>
It is the pointer or number (memory address) of a file in a hard disk.

### <b><ins><i>Hard Links</i></ins></b>
Linux stores administrative data about files in inodes. The inode is used to store all administrative data about files. Every file on Linux has an inode, and in the inode, important information about the file is stored:
* The data block where the file contents are stored.
* The creation, access, and modification date.
* Permissions.
* File owners.  
  
Just one important piece of information is not stored in the inode: the name of the file. Names are stored in the directory, and each filename knows which inode it has to address to access further file information. It is interesting to know that an inode does not know which name it has; it just knows how many names are associated with the inode. These names are referred to as hard links. When you create a file, you give it a name. Basically, this name is a hard link. On a Linux file system, multiple hard links can be created to a file. This can be useful, because it enables you to access the file from multiple different locations. Some restrictions apply to hard links, though:  
* Hard links must exist all on the same device (partition, logical volume, etc).
* You cannot create hard links to directories.
* When the last name (hard link) to a file is removed, access to the file’s data is also removed.  
  
The nice thing about hard links is that no difference exists between the first hard link and the second hard link. They are both just hard links, and if the first hard link that ever existed for a file is removed, that does not impact the other hard links that
still exist. The Linux operating system uses links on many locations to make files more accessible.  
  
Deleting renaming or moving the original file will not affect the hard link.
```bash
ln # Creates a hard link
```
  
### <b><ins><i>Symbolic/Soft Links</i></ins></b>  
A symbolic link (also referred to as soft link) does not link directly to the inode but to the name of the file. This makes symbolic links much more flexible, but it also has some disadvantages. The advantage of symbolic links is that they can link to files on other devices, as well as on directories. The major disadvantage is that when the original file is removed, the symbolic link becomes invalid and does not work any longer.  
  
Link will be removed if file is removed or renamed.  
  
```bash
ln -s # Creates a soft link.
```
![alt text](https://github.com/DevenSuji/MasteringLinux/blob/main/Pictures/link.PNG?raw=true)
  
### <b><ins><i>Creating Links</i></ins></b>
Use the ln command to create links. It uses the same order of parameters as cp and mv; first you mention the source name, followed by the destination name. If you want to create a symbolic link, you use the option -s, and then you specify the source and target file or directory. One important restriction applies, however: to be able to create hard links, you must be the owner of the item that you want to link to. This is a relatively new security restriction that was introduced in RHEL 7.
```bash
ln /etc/hosts . # Creates a link to the file /etc/hosts in the current directory
ln -s /etc/hosts . # Creates a symbolic link to the file /etc/hosts in the current directory
ln -s /home /tmp # Creates a symbolic link to the directory /home in the directory /tmp
```  
  
The ls command will reveal whether a file is a link:  
* In the output of the ls -l command, the first character is an l if the file is a symbolic link.
* If a file is a symbolic link, the output of ls -l shows the name of the item it links to after the filename.
* If a file is a hard link, ls -l shows the hard link counter. In the output in Example 3-4, this is the number 3 that is right before root root for the hosts file.
```bash
[root@localhost tmp]# \ls -l
total 3
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 5 Jan 19 04:38 home -> /home
-rw-r--r--. 3 root root 158 Jun 7 2013 hosts
```
NOTE: The command used is \ls -l, not ls -l. The ls command by default is an alias, which takes care of using the different colors when showing ls output; the \ in front of the command causes the alias not to be used.
NOTE: One cannot create soft or hard link within the same directory with the same name. 
  
# <b><ins><i>Working with Archives and Compressed Files</i></ins></b>  

### <b><ins><i>Managing Archives with tar</i></ins></b>
The Tape ARchiver (tar) utility is used to archive files. Although originally designed to stream files to a backup tape, in its current use tar is used mostly to write files to an archive file. You have to be able to perform four important tasks with tar on the RHCSA exam:  
* Create an archive.
* List the contents of an archive.
* Extract an archive.
* Compress and uncompress archives.  
    
### <b><ins><i>Creating Archives with tar</i></ins></b>
To create an archive, you use the <i>tar -cf archivename.tar /files-you-want-toarchive</i> command. If you want to see what is happening, use the -v option as well. To put files in an archive, you need at least read permissions to the file and execute permissions on the directory the file resides in. Use tar -cvf /root/homes.tar /home as user root to write the contents of the /home directory and everything
below it to the file homes.tar in the directory /root. Notice the options that are used; the order in these options is important.
```bash
tar -cvf archivename.tar /files-you-want-toarchive # Creating a new tar file
```  
### <b><ins><i>Adding a file to tar file</i></ins></b>
While managing archives with tar, it is also possible to add a file to an existing archive or to update an archive. To add a file to an archive, you use the -r options. Use, for instance, tar -rvf /root/homes.tar /etc/hosts to add the /etc/hosts file to the archive.  
```bash
tar -rvf /root/homes.tar /etc/hosts # To add a file to an existing tar file.
```  
### <b><ins><i>Updating a tar file</i></ins></b>
To update a currently existing archive file, you can use the -u option. So, use tar -uvf /root/homes.tar /home to write newer versions of all files in /home to the archive.
```bash
tar -uvf /root/homes.tar /home # To update and existing tar file.
```  
### <b><ins><i>Reading a tar file</i></ins></b>
Before extracting a file, it is good to know what might be expected. The option -t can be used to find out. Type, for instance, tar -tvf /root/homes.tar to see the contents of the tar archive.
```bash
tar -tvf /root/homes.tar # To see the contents of the tar file
```
NOTE : It is good practice to create archive files with an extension such as .tar or .tgz so that they can be easily recognized, but not everyone does that. If you think that a file is a tar archive, but you are not sure, use the file command. If you type file somefile, for instance, the file command analyzes its contents and shows on the command line what type of file it is.
```bash
[devensuji@tower ~]$ file passwd
passwd: symbolic link to /etc/passwd
``` 
### <b><ins><i>Extracting a tar file</i></ins></b> 
To extract the contents of an archive, use tar -xvf /archivename. This extracts the archive in the current directory. That means that if you are in /root when typing tar -xvf /root/homes.tar, and the file contains a directory /home, after extracting you’ll have a new directory /root/home that contains the entire contents of the file. This might not be what you wanted to accomplish. There are two solutions to put the extracted contents right where you want to have them:  
  
* Before extracting the archive file, cd to the directory where you want to extract the file.
* Use the option -C /targetdir to specify the target directory where you want to extract the file to. If you want to put the contents of the file /root/homes.tar in the directory /tmp, for instance, you can use tar -xvf homes.tar -C /tmp.
```bash
tar -xvf homes.tar -C /tmp # Extracting homes.tar to /tmp using the -C option.
```  
### <b><ins><i>Extracting a single file from a tar file</i></ins></b>  
Apart from extracting an entire archive file, it is also possible to extract one file out of the archive. To do so, use tar -xvf /archivename.tar file-you-want-to-extract. If your archive etc.tar contains the file /etc/hosts that you want to extract, for instance,
use tar -xvf /root/etc.tar etc/hosts.
```bash
tar -xvf /root/etc.tar etc/hosts # Extracting the file hosts from the tar file.
```

### <b><ins><i>Compressing Files</i></ins></b>
Originally, after creating the archive, it had to be compressed with a separate compression utility, such as gzip or bzip2.  
  
As an alternative to using these utilities from the command line, you can include the -z (gzip) or -j (bzip2) option while creating the archive with tar.  
| Option | Use |   
|:-------|:----------|
| c | Creates an archive. |
| v | Shows verbose output while tar is working. |
| t | Shows the contents of an archive. |
| z | Compresses/decompresses the archive while creating it, by using gzip. |
| j | Compresses/decompresses the archive by using bzip2. |
| x | Extracts an archive. |
| u | Updates an archive; only newer files will be written to the archive. |
| C | Changes the working directory before performing the command. |
| r | Appends files to an archive. |

# <b><ins><i>Modifying Permissions With CHMOD</i></ins></b>


### <b><ins><i>Modifying Permissions Using UGO</i></ins></b>
In Linux, file permissions are applied to 3 types of users viz User, Group and Others.
The CHMOD command works on a file, directory and links.
```bash
-rwxrwxrwx. 1 root root 0 Jul 22 12:42 jerry
```
In the above example in the first you see a hypen (-). This indicates we are looking at the file.
The first occurance of rwx is the permission set for the user.
The second occurance of rwx is the permission set for group.
The third occurance of rwx is the permission set for others.
1 is the counter.
The first occurance of root is the user.
The first occurance of root is the group.
0 is the others.
July 22 is the date.
12:42 is the time.
jerry is the name of the file. 

```bash
chmod a-r jerry # This will remove read permission for all the users from the file jerry. Note a here stand for all.
chmod o+r jerry # This will add read permission for others on the file jerry. Note o here stand for others.
chmod ug+r jerry # This will add read permission for user and group on the file jerry. Note u and g here stand for user and group. 
```

# <b><ins><i>File/Folder Ownership</i></ins></b>  
  
# <b><ins><i>Modifying Ownership With CHOWN and CHGRP</i></ins></b>
  
There are two owners of a file or a directory (User and Group).  
  
CHOWN changes the ownership of a file/folder.  
  
CHGRP changes the group ownership of a file/folder.  
  
Recursive ownership change can be done using the -R option.

```bash
