### <b><ins><i>Reading file while it refreshes</i></ins></b>
A useful option that you can use with tail is -f. This option starts by showing you the last ten lines of the file youâ€™ve specified, but it refreshes the display as new lines are added to the file.
```bash
tail -f /var/log/messages # The log messages keeps refreshing
```
### <b><ins><i>Head and Tail</i></ins></b>

Both head and tail are used to read files. By default head will render first 10 lines of the file and tail will render the last 10 lines of the file. We can also increase or decrease the the number of lines it displays by adding -n Number_Of_Lines or by just adding -Number_Of_Lines. See the examples below.
```bash
head -n 5 /etc/passwd
head -5 /etc/passwd
tail -n 15 /etc/passwd
tail -15 /etc/passwd
```

### <b><ins><i>Filtering Specific Columns with cut</i></ins></b>
When working with text files, it can be useful to filter out specific fields. Imagine that you need to see a list of all users in the /etc/passwd file. In this file, several fields are defined, of which the first contains the name of the users who are defined.
To filter out a specific field, the cut command is useful. To do this, use the -d option to specify the field delimiter followed by -f with the number of the specific field you want to filter out. So, the complete command is cut -d : -f 1 /etc/passwd if you want to filter out the first field of the /etc/passwd file.
