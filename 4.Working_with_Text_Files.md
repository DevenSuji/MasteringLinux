| Command | Explanation |   
|:-------|:----------|
| less | Opens the text file in a pager, which allows for easy reading. |
| cat | Dumps the contents of the text file on the screen |
| head | Shows the first ten lines of the text file |
| tail | Shows the last ten lines of the text file |
| cut | Used to filter specific columns or characters from a text file |
| sort | Sorts the contents of a text file |
| wc | Counts the number of lines, words, and characters in a file |

### <b><ins><i>Reading file while it refreshes</i></ins></b>
A useful option that you can use with tail is -f. This option starts by showing you the last ten lines of the file youâ€™ve specified, but it refreshes the display as new lines are added to the file.
```bash
tail -f /var/log/messages # The log messages keeps refreshing
```
### <b><ins><i>Head and Tail</i></ins></b>

Both head and tail are used to read files. By default head will render first 10 lines of the file and tail will render the last 10 lines of the file. We can also increase or decrease the the number of lines it displays by adding -n Number_Of_Lines or by just adding -Number_Of_Lines. See the examples below.
```bash
head -n 5 /etc/passwd
head -5 /etc/passwd
tail -n 15 /etc/passwd
tail -15 /etc/passwd
```

### <b><ins><i>Filtering Specific Columns with cut</i></ins></b>
When working with text files, it can be useful to filter out specific fields. Imagine that you need to see a list of all users in the /etc/passwd file. In this file, several fields are defined, of which the first contains the name of the users who are defined. To filter out a specific field, the cut command is useful. To do this, use the -d option to specify the field delimiter followed by -f with the number of the specific field you want to filter out. So, the complete command is cut -d : -f 1 /etc/passwd if you want to filter out the first field of the /etc/passwd file. 
```bash
cut -f 1 -d : /etc/passwd
```

### <b><ins><i>Sorting File Contents and Output with sort</i></ins></b>
This command sorts text. By default, the sort command sorts in byte order. Notice that this looks like alphabetical order, but it is not, as all capital letters are shown before lowercase letters. So Zoo would be listed before apple. In some cases, that is not convenient because the content that needs sorting may be numeric or in another format. The sort command offers different options to help sorting these specific types of data.

```bash
sort /etc/passwd # Sorting.
cut -f 1 -d : /etc/passwd | sort # Piping the output of cut command to sort command.
cut -f 2 -d : /etc/passwd | sort -n # to sort the second field of the /etc/passwd file in numeric order.
du -h | sort -rn # Sorting in reverse order. Here you get a list of files sorted with the biggest file in that directory listed first.
```
You can also use the sort command and specify which column you want to sort. To do this use the below command, for instance, which uses the field separator : to sort the third column of the /etc/passwd file.
```bash
sort -k3 -t : /etc/passwd
```

### <b><ins><i>Counting Lines, Words, and Characters with wc</i></ins></b>
The wc command gives three different results: the number of lines, the number of words, and the number of characters.
```bash
[devensuji@tower ~]$ ps aux | wc
     93    1071    8032
```
In the above commands output  
93 is the number of lines.  
1071 are the number of words and  
8032 are the number of characters.
