# <b><ins><i>Regular Expressions in Linux</i></ins></b>
A regular expression is a search pattern that allows you to look for specific text in an advanced and flexible way.  
  
| Regular Expression | Use |
|:-------|:----------|
| ^text | Matches line that starts with specified text. | 
| text$ | Matches line that ends with specified text. | 
| . | Wildcard. (Matches any single character.) | 
| [abc] | Matches a, b, or c. | 
| * | Matches zero to an infinite number of the previous character. | 
|  \{2\} | Matches exactly two of the previous character. | 
| \{1,3\} Matches a minimum of one and a maximum of three of the previous character. | 
| colou?r | Matches zero or one of the previous character. This makes the previous character optional, which in this example would match both color and colour. |
