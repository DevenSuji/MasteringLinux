# <b><ins><i>GREP</i></ins></b>
The ultimate utility to work with regular expressions is grep, which stands for <b><ins><i>“general regular expression parser.”</i></ins></b>

| Option | Use |
|:-------|:----------|
| -i | Not case sensitive. Matches upper- and lowercase letters. | 
| -v | Only shows lines that do not contain the regular expression. | 
| -r | Searches files in the current directory and all subdirectories. | 
| -e | Searches for lines matching more than one regular expression. | 
| -A | <number> Shows <number> of lines after the matching regular expression. | 
| -B | <number> Shows <number> of lines before the matching regular expression. | 

# <b><ins><i>Examples to try</i></ins></b>
```bash
grep '^#' /etc/sysconfig/sshd # This shows that the file /etc/sysconfig/sshd contains a number of lines that start with the comment sign, #.
grep -v '^#' /etc/sysconfig/sshd # This shows only those lines that do not start with a #.
grep -v '^#' /etc/sysconfig/sshd -B 5 # This shows lines that do not start with a # sign but also the five lines that are directly before each of those lines
grep -v -e '^#' -e '^$' /etc/sysconfig/sshd # This excludes all blank lines and lines that start with #.
```
# <b><ins><i>AWK and SED</i></ins></b>
Some even more powerful utilities exist, like awk and sed, both of which are extremely rich.

```bash
awk -F : '{ print $4 }' /etc/passwd # This command shows the fourth line from /etc/passwd
  
awk -F : '/user/ { print $4 }' /etc/passwd # This command searches the /etc/passwd file for the text user and will print the fourth field of any matching line.
```

The sed utility is a very powerful utility for filtering text from text files (like grep), but it has the benefit that it also allows you to apply modifications to text files,  
```bash
sed -n 5p /etc/passwd # This is used to print the fifth line from the /etc/passwd file
```

```bash
sed -i s/old-text/new-text/g ~/myfile # Replacing old-text to new-text in the file myfile
```
The sed utility is used to search for the text old-text in ~/myfile and replace all occurrences with the text new-text. Notice that the default sed behavior is to write the output to STDOUT, but the option -i will write the result directly to the file. Make sure that you know what you are doing before using this command, because it might be difficult to revert file modifications that are applied in this way.
